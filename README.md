## Usage

> __Environment Variables__ GitPal has hardcoded a username of 'neo4j' and a password of 'neo' for neo4j. You can change these in the code or override them by setting the appropriate environment variables. You will also need a GitHub Client ID and Client Secret to use the GitHub API. These, too, are set as environment variables. We have used the .env package, which allows environment variables to be set easily with the .env file in the root directory of the project. An example of the necessary variables for GitPal been provided here in this repo.

- Fork and clone the repo
- Install dependencies from the root of the repo by running
```sh
npm install
```
- [Download](https://neo4j.com/download/community-edition) and install neo4j
- Start the neo4j server (OS dependent)
- Seed the database by running:
```sh
npm run seed
```
- Transpile the JSX files with
```sh
npm run dev
```
> __NOTE__ This sets webpack to watch your /client files for changes
- Run the following command to start the server
```sh
npm start
```
> __NOTE__ This runs nodemon, which will watch server.js and your /server files for changes
- Open localhost:8080 in your browser to start using the application.
